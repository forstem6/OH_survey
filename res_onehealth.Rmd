## Intro

Quick overview over the results of the OneHealth survey. 

The survey was active between 17.02.2022 and 31.03.2022. As the exact number of people, who might be the target population for the survey, was unclear, all scientific personnel of the university has been invited to participate (N = ~750). 
In total, `r nrow(res_raw)` scientists opened in the survey, of those **`r nrow(res_2)`** gave at least one response.  

Below there is a table containing all questions and a quick overview over the main descriptive statistics. I also left the open-ended questions in the table for a better overview (especially the "other" fields, where participants specified not-listed response options). To gain more insights into the different responses to all open-ended questions, the respective responses are listed again below in separate tables. 

## Summary table

The first variable indicates where the participants stopped answering the survey. As shown, 115 participants completed the survey and 28 quit at/after the first page, but still answering at least one question. All results have all participants who answered the respective questions included, resulting in a varying number of missing values. This however also means the "missing" column does not distinguish between participants having quit the survey before the question and participants explicitly not answering the question. 

```{r dfsummary, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Make a tabular summary of the results with dfSummary()

# First exclude ID, Comments and contact.
res_numeric <- select(res_2, -c("id", "G02Q14", "G08Q18"))
res_num <- dfSummary(res_numeric,
                     valid.col       = FALSE,
                     headings = FALSE,
                     style        = "grid",

# Now change the variable names to understand the questions.
# For this we first need to get rid of the slashes.
